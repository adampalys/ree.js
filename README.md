#### Library for building 3D tools for three.js ####

The goal of this project is to provide a library for building complex 3D applications such as CAD and 3D animation tools. It relies on [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and [carbon.js](https://github.com/arodic/carbon.js/).

### Motivation ###

Building complex software such as computer graphics tools has always been a challenge with web technology. Libraries such as [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) solve some of the big problems around the complexity of [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/) API. However, building complex and articulated applications is still an unsolved problem. This library is an attempt to solve it.
